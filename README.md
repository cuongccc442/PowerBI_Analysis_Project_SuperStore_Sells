# In this project, I utilized Power BI to create a comprehensive sales visualization for a retail store. The process involved the following steps:

# Data Importation: Imported the sales data from multiple sources, ensuring proper connectivity and integration within Power BI.
# Data Cleaning: Applied data cleaning techniques to remove inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the dataset.
# Data Modeling: Developed a robust Data Dimensional Schema (DDS) by identifying key entities, relationships, and hierarchies, which included designing the data model using star or snowflake schema principles.
# Schema Creation: Established the appropriate data schema to organize the dataset, optimizing it for analysis and reporting.
# Dashboard Development: Designed an interactive and visually intuitive dashboard, providing key sales insights such as revenue trends, product performance, customer segmentation, and regional sales distributions.
# The result was a well-structured Power BI solution that empowers stakeholders with actionable insights into the store's sales performance.
